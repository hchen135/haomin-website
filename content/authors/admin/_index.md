I am a PhD student of computer science in Johns Hopkins University. My research interests include transparent systems, medical imaging and computer vision. I have research experience about transparent deep learning systems for both 2D and 3D medical images; both radiological and pathological images; both classification and detection problems, with both PyTorch and Tensowflow packages.
