        Symmetric learning for Fracture Detection in Pelvic Trauma X-ray:

        * Deployed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan ans used by > 5000 patients. 
        * Paper accepted by ECCV 2020 with poster.
        * Improved detection AUC from 0.95 to 0.98 and fracture recall from 0.89 to 0.93 (FPR=0.1).
        * Mimicked radiologists to detect fractures by comparing bilateral symmetric regions.
        * Focused on anatomical asymmetry with contrastive learning.
