        Interpretable Video Translation:

        * I created the largest dataset of speaking face videos from a wild source - YouTube. 
        * I established an algorithm for synchronization between translated audio and original video at the sentence level in a multiperson and multilingual situation. 
        * I refined the facial landmark generation network for better articulation. 
        * I used the diffusion technique to achieve immersive lip synchronization in videos with translated audio.
        * In an internal user study, my video-audio synchronization proved to be more robust and generalizable compared to a similar product from ElevenLabs.

        3D scene style transfer with 2D style image by differential rendering:

        * Internship performance exceeds mentor/peers' expectation in review.
        * Learned style transfer, 3D mesh and rendering from scratch in one week.
        * Utilized PyTorch3D \& nvdiffrast as differential rendering to generate 2D views.
        * Optimized texture maps by style transfer between 2D rendered images and style image.
        * Preserved object style consistency by semantic style transfer.

        Symmetric learning for Fracture Detection in Pelvic Trauma X-ray:

        * Paper accepted by ECCV 2020 with poster presentation.
        * Mimicked radiologists' practice by comparing vertical asymmetric areas via Siamese network.
        * Aligned Siamese features according to GNN-detected pelvic structure landmarks.
        * Learned anatomical asymmetry explicitly by novel pixel-wise contrastive loss.

        Deep Hierarchical Multi-label Classification of Chest X-ray:
    
        * Paper accepted by MIDL 2019 with oral presentation.
        * Special invitation to Journal ``Medical Image Analysis" and paper accepted.
        * Followed clinical taxonomy to construct hierarchical multi-label classification.
        * Developed a two-stage training procedure to fit the extreme label imbalance dataset.
        * Derived a numerically stable math formulation to avoid floating point underflow calculating loss.

        Lung nodule detection in CT images:

        * Achieved rank 6 out of 2887 teams in the Skylake competition sponsored by Intel and Alibaba.
        * Applied PyTorch, 3D UNet and Caffe, Faster RCNN to detect lung nodules in 1000 CT scans.
        * Used fusion method to achieve false positive reduction.
